# PTAS Websites

## Project Overview

Turborepo monorepo (Bun workspaces) for two German B2B websites, both built with Next.js 16 and Tailwind CSS 4:

- **ptas.de**: PTAS (Personentransport-Abrechnungsservice), billing service for patient transport
- **taxiware.de**: Taxiware, a new product (site in early setup)

## Architecture

```text
apps/
├── ptas/           # ptas.de (port 3000)
│   ├── app/        # App Router pages (German routes)
│   ├── components/ # PTAS-specific React components
│   └── content/    # Legal texts loaded at build time
└── taxiware/       # taxiware.de (port 3001)
packages/
└── ui/             # @repo/ui: shared shadcn/ui components, cn(), base theme
    └── src/
        ├── components/
        ├── lib/utils.ts
        └── styles/globals.css
```

Keep brand-specific code (header, footer, pages, metadata, analytics, legal texts) in the app. Only move code to `packages/` once both sites need it.

## Key Commands

Run from the repo root:

```bash
bun install                            # Install dependencies for all workspaces
bun run dev                            # Start both dev servers (3000 and 3001)
bunx turbo run dev --filter=ptas       # Start a single app
bun run build                          # Build all apps (cached by Turborepo)
bun run check-types                    # Type check all workspaces
bun run lint                           # Format & lint with Biome (auto-fix)
```

## Code Patterns

### UI Components

- Use shadcn/ui components from `@repo/ui/components/*`
- Icons: `lucide-react`
- Class merging: `cn()` from `@repo/ui/lib/utils`
- `@/*` points to the current app's own folder

```tsx
import { Button } from "@repo/ui/components/button";
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@repo/ui/components/card";
import { cn } from "@repo/ui/lib/utils";
```

### Styling Conventions

- Tailwind CSS 4
- Shared theme tokens live in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
- Each app's `app/global.css` imports `@repo/ui/globals.css` and overrides brand colors (`--primary`, ...)

### Language

- All user-facing content is **German**
- HTML lang attribute: `de`
- Route names in German (e.g., `/abrechnung`, `/vorfinanzierung`)

## Adding shadcn Components

Run the CLI from the app that needs the component:

```bash
cd apps/ptas
bunx --bun shadcn@latest add [component]
```

UI primitives are installed to `packages/ui/src/components`, composed blocks to the app's `components/`.

## Deployment

Each app is its own Azure Static Web App with its own Azure-generated workflow (`.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-<adjective>-<noun>-<hex>.yml`; ptas.de is `...-red-wave-039b6b203.yml`, taxiware.de is `...-nice-bay-081b6af03.yml`).

- The apps use different deployment authorization policies, and each workflow must match its app's policy, or Azure rejects the upload with "No matching Static Web App was found or the api key was invalid":
  - ptas.de uses **GitHub** (OIDC): `id-token: write`, a "Get Id Token" step and `github_id_token` are required.
  - taxiware.de uses **Deployment token**: only `azure_static_web_apps_api_token`. Don't add `github_id_token` unless the policy is switched to GitHub in the Azure portal (Settings → Configuration).
- Never rename these files or move them out of `.github/workflows/`. Azure links each app to its workflow file, and with the GitHub policy it identifies the target app from the filename in the OIDC token.
- Don't move the deploy step into a reusable workflow (`workflow_call`), since that changes the workflow named in the token.
- Shared build steps live in the composite action `.github/actions/build-standalone`. It builds one app with Turborepo and flattens the Next.js standalone output.
- Each deploy workflow is filtered to paths that affect its app.
- `ci.yml` lints, type checks and builds everything.

## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

# This is NOT the Turborepo you know

Turborepo configuration, task behavior, and CLI commands can vary between installed versions and may differ from your training data. Resolve the `turbo` package from this file's directory or relevant workspace; in monorepos, it may not be visible from the repository root. For example, run `node -p "require.resolve('turbo/package.json')"` from a workspace that depends on `turbo`.

Read `docs/README.md` inside that installed package first, then read the relevant pages from its `docs/` directory before changing Turborepo configuration or commands. Heed deprecation notices. These bundled docs match the installed package version and are available without network access.

This block is written and re-added by `turbo` before repository-scoped commands when an AI agent is detected. In the Turborepo source repository, its template is defined in `crates/turborepo-cli/src/cli/agent_guidance.rs`. Removing the managed block while updates are enabled means a later qualifying invocation will add it again. Set `"agentGuidance": false` in the root `turbo.json` or `turbo.jsonc` to opt out; this does not remove an existing block. Keep the block committed with your work to avoid an uncommitted change on the next agent invocation.
